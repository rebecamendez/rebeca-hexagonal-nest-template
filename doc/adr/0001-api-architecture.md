# ADR 0001: REST API Architecture üèóÔ∏è

## Status
Accepted ‚úÖ

## Context
Need for a scalable and maintainable REST API architecture that enables efficient task and project management.

## Decision
Implement a pragmatic layered architecture inspired by Hexagonal Architecture:

### Monolithic Modular Approach üè∞
We have chosen to implement a modular monolithic architecture as our initial approach for several reasons:

#### Why Monolithic?
- We are developing a product from scratch, and premature optimization could lead to unnecessary complexity
- The current scale and requirements don't justify the overhead of distributed systems
- Faster development cycles and simpler deployment process
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Lower operational costs during early stages

#### Modular Design Benefits üß©
Our modular approach provides several advantages:
- Clear boundaries between features through self-contained modules
- Each module encapsulates its own domain logic, infrastructure, and presentation
- Easier to maintain and test individual components
- Natural alignment with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:
  - Each module represents a bounded context
  - Clear domain boundaries within modules
  - Rich domain models within each module
  - Explicit interfaces between modules

#### Future Evolution Path üöÄ
While we start with a modular monolith, our architecture is designed to evolve:
- CQRS: Can be implemented at the module level when needed
- Event-Driven: Can be gradually introduced through event sourcing
- Microservices: Modules can be extracted into microservices if scaling requirements demand it

The key is to maintain a pragmatic balance between current needs and future flexibility.

### Core Principles
- Domain Layer: Core business entities and domain logic (innermost layer)
- Application Layer: Business services and ports (orchestrates domain operations)
- Infrastructure Layer: External implementations (database, external services)
- Presentation Layer: Controllers and mappers (handles HTTP requests)
- Shared Contracts: Frontend-Backend communication (`@rebeca-hexagonal-nest-template/api-contract`)
- Dependency Injection: NestJS DI for loose coupling between layers

### Decision Rationale üéØ
Our architectural decisions are driven by several key considerations:

#### Why Hexagonal Architecture?
- Provides clear boundaries between business logic and external concerns
- Enables easy testing through port abstractions
- Allows for flexible infrastructure changes without affecting core business logic
- Aligns well with our modular monolith approach

#### Why NestJS?
- Built-in support for dependency injection and modular architecture
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Excellent developer experience and documentation
- Active community and regular updates
- Built-in support for OpenAPI/Swagger

#### Why Shared Contracts?
- Type safety across the entire stack
- Enables parallel frontend/backend development
- Single source of truth for API contracts
- Reduces integration issues
- Better developer experience with autocompletion

#### Why PostgreSQL?
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Excellent performance for our scale
- Rich feature set including JSON support
- Cost-effective for our current needs

#### Why TypeORM?
- Native TypeScript support
- Active query builder
- Rich feature set
- Good balance between features and complexity
- Strong integration with NestJS

### Architecture Overview
![API Architecture](./diagrams/api-architecture.drawio.png)

### Module Structure
```
modules/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/             # Feature module
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Business entities
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/     # Business logic
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/  # External implementations
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/    # Controllers
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Shared modules
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ root/              # Root module
```

### Shared Contracts
The communication between frontend and backend is handled through the `@rebeca-hexagonal-nest-template/api-contract` package:
- Contains DTOs for requests and responses
- Ensures type safety across the entire application
- Enables parallel development
- Shared between frontend and backend projects

### Implementation Examples

#### Presentation Layer üé®
```typescript
// @rebeca-hexagonal-nest-template/api-contract
export class TaskRequest {
  public title!: string;
  public description!: string;
}

export class TaskResponse {
  public id!: number;
  public title!: string;
  public description!: string;
}

// presentation/task.controller.ts
export class TaskController {
  public constructor(private readonly taskService: TaskService) {}

  @Get()
  public async getTasks(): Promise<TaskResponse[]> {
    const tasks = await this.taskService.getTasks();
    return tasks.map((task) => TaskMapper.toResponse(task));
  }

  @Post()
  public async createTask(@Body() request: TaskRequest): Promise<TaskResponse> {
    const task = await this.taskService.createTask(request.title, request.description);
    return TaskMapper.toResponse(task);
  }
}

// presentation/mappers/task.mapper.ts
export class TaskMapper {
  public static toResponse(task: Task): TaskResponse {
    const response = new TaskResponse();
    response.id = task.id;
    response.title = task.title;
    response.description = task.description;
    return response;
  }
}
```

#### Application Layer üîå
```typescript
// application/ports/task.repository.ts
export interface TaskRepository {
  getTasks(): Promise<Task[]>;
  getTask(id: number): Promise<Task>;
  createTask(title: string, description: string): Promise<Task>;
  updateTask(id: number, title: string, description: string): Promise<Task>;
  deleteTask(id: number): Promise<void>;
}

// application/task.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class TaskService {
  public constructor(@Inject(TASK_REPOSITORY) private readonly taskRepository: TaskRepository) {}

  public async getTasks(): Promise<Task[]> {
    return this.taskRepository.getTasks();
  }

  public async createTask(title: string, description: string): Promise<Task> {
    return this.taskRepository.createTask(title, description);
  }
}
```

#### Infrastructure Layer üîß
```typescript
// infrastructure/repositories/task.repository.adapter.ts
@Injectable()
export class TaskRepositoryAdapter implements TaskRepository {
  public constructor(
    @InjectRepository(Task)
    private readonly repository: Repository<Task>
  ) {}

  public async getTasks(): Promise<Task[]> {
    return this.repository.find();
  }

  public async createTask(title: string, description: string): Promise<Task> {
    const task = this.repository.create({ title, description });
    return this.repository.save(task);
  }
}

// infrastructure/repositories/task.repository.provider.ts
export const taskRepositoryProviders = [
  {
    provide: TASK_REPOSITORY,
    useClass: TaskRepositoryAdapter
  }
];
```

#### Domain Layer üéØ
```typescript
// domain/task.ts
export class Task {
  public id!: number;
  public title!: string;
  public description!: string;
}
```

### Tech Stack
- NestJS framework (v10+)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- PostgreSQL (v15+)
- TypeORM (v0.3+)
- OpenAPI/Swagger (v7+) for automatic API documentation
- Shared contracts package (`@rebeca-hexagonal-nest-template/api-contract`)

### API Documentation üìö
The API documentation is automatically generated using OpenAPI/Swagger:
- Available at `http://localhost:3000/api` when `ENABLE_OPENAPI=true`
- Interactive documentation with request/response examples
- Integration with shared contracts (`@rebeca-hexagonal-nest-template/api-contract`)
- Examples automatically generated from mocks
- Authentication and authorization support
- Schema and model documentation

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use dependency injection for all dependencies
- Keep domain entities pure and framework-agnostic
- Implement ports (interfaces) in application layer
- Use adapters for external implementations
- Map between DTOs and domain entities in presentation layer
- Handle errors at appropriate layer:
  - Domain errors in domain layer
  - Application errors in application layer
  - HTTP errors in presentation layer
- Use shared contracts for all API communication
- Follow NestJS best practices for decorators and metadata

### Error Handling Strategy üö®
Our error handling approach follows these principles:
- Domain errors are handled at the domain layer with rich domain models
- Application errors are transformed into appropriate HTTP responses
- Each layer has its own error types and handling mechanisms
- Errors are logged with appropriate context and severity
- Client receives meaningful error messages without exposing internal details

### Testing Strategy üß™
We follow a comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for domain logic and business rules
- Integration tests for application services and repositories
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Test coverage requirements:
  - Domain layer: 100%
  - Application layer: 90%
  - Infrastructure layer: 80%
  - Presentation layer: 80%
- Mocking strategy:
  - Use interfaces for external dependencies
  - Mock repositories in service tests
  - Use test doubles for external services
  - Avoid mocking domain logic

## Consequences
